## Recent Changes Completed

### 1. Arrow Key Direction Fix âœ…
**File Modified:** `/src/events/events.c`
- **Issue:** Left/Right arrow keys were controlling movement in reverse directions
- **Fix:** Swapped the movement directions:
  - LEFT arrow now moves objects to +X direction (0.3, 0, 0)
  - RIGHT arrow now moves objects to -X direction (-0.3, 0, 0)
- **Status:** âœ… Completed

### 2. Compilation Error Fix âœ…
**File Modified:** `/src/utils/transforms.c`
- **Issue:** Missing `#include <stdio.h>` causing compilation errors for printf statements
- **Fix:** Added the required header
- **Status:** âœ… Completed

### 3. Scene File Creation âœ…
**File Created:** `/scenes/columned_hall.rt`
- **Description:** Comprehensive columned hall scene with classical architecture
- **Features:**
  - 5 planes (floor, ceiling, 3 walls)
  - 1 central red sphere
  - Multiple cylinders and spheres forming classical columns
  - 36 total objects for complex rendering testing
  - Proper lighting setup with ambient and directional light
- **Status:** âœ… Completed

### 4. Performance Documentation âœ…
**File Created:** `/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md`
- **Description:** Comprehensive guide for performance optimization strategies
- **Covers:** Spatial acceleration, multi-threading, SIMD, memory optimization
- **Status:** âœ… Completed

## Current Issues & Debug Output

### Debug Printf Statements âœ…
**Files Affected:** `/src/utils/transforms.c`, `/src/events/events.c`
- **Issue:** Debug printf statements were causing console spam during camera/object movement and key presses
- **Fix:** Removed all debug output:
  - Line 144 in transforms.c: Object translate debug message
  - Line 204 in transforms.c: Camera translate debug message  
  - Line 39 in events.c: "Key pressed" debug message
  - Line 132 in events.c: "Selected object" debug message
- **Status:** âœ… Completed - No more console spam during interaction

## Performance Analysis

### Current Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Ray-Object Intersection Calculations** - O(n) complexity per pixel
2. **Lack of Spatial Acceleration** - No BVH, Octree, or similar structures
3. **Single-Threaded Rendering** - Not utilizing multiple CPU cores
4. **Memory Allocation** - Frequent allocations during rendering
5. **Complex Mathematical Operations** - Expensive trigonometric functions

### Estimated Performance Impact
- **Current:** ~1-5 seconds for simple scenes, 30+ seconds for complex scenes
- **With Optimizations:** Potential 20-100x speedup for complex scenes
