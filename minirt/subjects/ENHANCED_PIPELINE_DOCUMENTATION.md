# Introduction & Prerequisites

Welcome to the Enhanced MiniRT Raytracing Documentation! This guide is designed for absolute beginners—even if you have never studied trigonometry or algebra before. We'll break down every concept step by step, using simple language, analogies, and hands-on examples.

## What is Raytracing?
Raytracing is a way for computers to create realistic images by simulating how light travels and bounces off objects. Imagine shining a flashlight in a dark room: the light travels in straight lines (rays), bounces off walls and objects, and eventually reaches your eyes. Raytracing does the same thing, but with math!

## Why Do We Need Math?
To figure out where the light goes, we need to describe things like:
- Where objects are (points in 3D space)
- Which way things are pointing (vectors)
- How far things are from each other (distance)
- How light bounces (angles, directions)

Don't worry if these words sound new—we'll explain everything from scratch!

## How to Use This Guide
- Read each section in order. Each part builds on the last.
- Try the hands-on exercises as you go—they'll help you understand the ideas.
- Check the glossary if you see a word you don't know.

## Glossary (Quick Reference)
- **Point**: A location in space, like a dot on a piece of paper, but in 3D.
- **Vector**: An arrow with a direction and a length (how far, and which way).
- **Ray**: Like a laser beam—starts at a point and goes forever in one direction.
- **Dot Product**: A way to measure how much two arrows point in the same direction.
- **Cross Product**: A way to find a new arrow that is at a right angle to two others.
- **Normalization**: Making an arrow exactly 1 unit long (not changing its direction).
- **Intersection**: The point where two things (like a ray and a sphere) meet.
- **Ambient Light**: The general light in a room, not coming from any one place.
- **Diffuse Light**: Light that hits a surface directly, like sunlight on your face.
- **Attenuation**: How light gets dimmer as it travels farther.
- **Epsilon**: A tiny number used to say "close enough" when comparing numbers.

# Basic Math Concepts for Beginners

Before we dive into raytracing, let's get comfortable with the basic math ideas you'll see everywhere in this guide. We'll use simple analogies and diagrams to make things clear!

## What is a Point?
A **point** is just a location in space. Imagine a tiny dot floating in the air. In 3D, we write its position as (x, y, z). For example, (2, 3, 5) means:
- 2 steps to the right
- 3 steps up
- 5 steps forward

## What is a Vector?
A **vector** is like an arrow. It has:
- A direction (which way it points)
- A length (how far it goes)

Think of a vector as "go 3 steps right, 4 steps up, 0 steps forward." We write this as (3, 4, 0).

### Visualizing a Vector
```
Start at (0,0,0), go 3 right, 4 up:

   ^ y
   |
 4 +
   |
   |
   +------> x
      3
```

## Quick Reference: Essential Concepts

# Camera & Ray Generation (Quick Overview)

This section provides a quick overview. For complete step-by-step explanations with examples, see the [Camera Mathematics](#2-camera-mathematics-from-screen-pixels-to-3d-rays) section below.

## Field of View (FOV)
FOV determines how wide your camera can see - like the difference between a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens.

- **Wide FOV**: Like a GoPro camera—shows a lot, but things look smaller.
- **Narrow FOV**: Like a telescope—shows a small area, but zoomed in.

## Pixel to Ray Process
1. **Calculate pixel scale**: `pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)`
2. **Center coordinates**: `u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale`  
3. **Build 3D direction**: `direction = normalize(Right×u + Up×v + Forward)`

**Example**: Click pixel (600,150) on 800×600 screen with FOV=90°
- Results in 3D ray direction (0.424, 0.318, 0.848)

**Diagram:**
```
Screen (top view):

   0,0 +-------------------+
       |                   |
       |         *         |  <-- center (400,300)
       |                   |
       +-------------------+
           800,600

Click at (600,150):
- 200 pixels right of center
- 150 pixels up from center
```

**Key Takeaway:**
Every pixel on the screen becomes a unique direction in 3D space. By following these steps, we can figure out exactly where to send our "laser beam" (ray) for each pixel!

## Mathematical Foundations Explained from First Principles

### 0. Prerequisites: Basic Concepts You Need to Know

#### What is a Vector?
A **vector** is simply a direction and distance in space. Think of it as an arrow:
- **Position Vector**: Points from origin (0,0,0) to a location, like (3,4,5)
- **Direction Vector**: Shows which way something is pointing, like (1,0,0) means "pointing right"
- **Length/Magnitude**: How long the vector is, calculated as √(x² + y² + z²)

#### Vector Operations (The Building Blocks)
1. **Addition**: (a,b,c) + (x,y,z) = (a+x, b+y, c+z)
   - Like walking: first go (3,4,0), then go (1,-2,0), you end up at (4,2,0)

2. **Scalar Multiplication**: k × (x,y,z) = (k×x, k×y, k×z)
   - Like stretching: 2 × (1,2,3) = (2,4,6) makes the vector twice as long

3. **Dot Product**: A·B = Ax×Bx + Ay×By + Az×Bz
   - Measures how "similar" two directions are
   - Result = 0 means perpendicular, positive means same general direction

4. **Cross Product**: A×B gives a vector perpendicular to both A and B
   - Used to find "up" direction when you know "forward" and "right"

5. **Normalization**: normalize(V) = V / |V| (makes length = 1)
   - Like keeping the direction but making the arrow exactly 1 unit long

### 1. What is a Ray? (The Foundation of Everything)

#### Intuitive Understanding
Imagine you're holding a laser pointer. The laser beam is a **ray**:
- It starts at your finger (the **origin**)
- It goes in a straight line (the **direction**)
- It extends infinitely far (unless it hits something)

#### Mathematical Definition
A ray is mathematically written as:
```
R(t) = O + t × D
```

**Breaking this down step by step:**
- **O** = Starting point (origin) - like (camera_x, camera_y, camera_z)
- **D** = Direction vector - like (0.5, 0.3, 0.8) means "go right-ish, up-ish, forward-ish"
- **t** = How far along the ray (t=0 is at start, t=1 is one unit away, etc.)
- **R(t)** = The actual point in 3D space at distance t

**Real Example:**
If camera is at (0,0,0) and direction is (1,0,0), then:
- R(0) = (0,0,0) + 0×(1,0,0) = (0,0,0) - still at camera
- R(1) = (0,0,0) + 1×(1,0,0) = (1,0,0) - one unit to the right
- R(5) = (0,0,0) + 5×(1,0,0) = (5,0,0) - five units to the right

**Key Insight:**
A ray is like a straight road in 3D space:
- It starts at the origin (your location)
- It goes in the direction of the destination
- You can find any point on the ray by traveling a certain distance (t) from the origin.

### 2. Camera Mathematics: From Screen Pixels to 3D Rays

#### The Problem We're Solving
You click on pixel (100, 200) on your screen. But your 3D world doesn't know about "pixels" - it knows about 3D coordinates. We need to convert that pixel into a ray shooting into the 3D world.

#### Step 1: Understanding Field of View (FOV) - The Complete Picture

**What does FOV mean in everyday terms?**
Imagine you're looking through a camera or your eyes. The Field of View (FOV) is how much you can see from side to side—like the width of your vision.

**Examples to visualize:**
- **Human eyes**: ~180° FOV (we can see almost behind us)
- **Normal camera**: ~50-70° FOV (like a standard lens)
- **Telephoto lens**: ~20-30° FOV (zoomed in, narrow view)
- **Wide-angle lens**: ~90-120° FOV (very wide view)

**Visualizing the Camera View as a Triangle**
Think of the camera as being at the tip of a triangle:
- The triangle opens up in front of the camera, showing what it can see
- The angle at the tip is the FOV (for example, 90°)
- The wider the angle, the more you can see

**Where does tan(FOV/2) come from? - Step by Step**

Let's draw this triangle in text:
```
      /|
     / |
    /  | <--- This is a right triangle!
   /   |
  /FOV/2
 /_____|
camera  distance = 1
```

**Step 1: Split the problem in half**
- The full FOV forms a triangle that opens left and right
- If we split this in half, we get a right triangle on one side
- The angle at the camera corner is now FOV/2 (half the full angle)

**Step 2: Set up the right triangle**
- **Camera position**: at the corner (0,0)
- **Straight ahead**: goes distance 1 forward (this is the "adjacent" side)
- **To the edge**: goes sideways to the edge of view (this is the "opposite" side)

**Step 3: Use trigonometry**
In any right triangle, the tangent function connects angles to side lengths:
```
tan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side
```

In our camera triangle:
- **angle** = FOV/2
- **adjacent side** = 1 (distance straight ahead)
- **opposite side** = how far we can see sideways (the "half-width")

So:
```
tan(FOV/2) = half-width / 1
=> half-width = tan(FOV/2)
```

**Why this is useful:**
- tan(FOV/2) tells us how "wide" the camera can see on ONE side
- At distance 1, if FOV = 90°, then tan(45°) = 1, so we can see 1 unit to each side
- At distance 1, if FOV = 60°, then tan(30°) ≈ 0.577, so we can see 0.577 units to each side

**Real Example with Numbers:**
```
FOV = 90°  => tan(45°) = 1.0     => Can see ±1.0 units at distance 1
FOV = 60°  => tan(30°) = 0.577   => Can see ±0.577 units at distance 1  
FOV = 120° => tan(60°) = 1.732   => Can see ±1.732 units at distance 1
```

**Key insight for beginners:**
- Split the FOV angle in half to work with right triangles
- Use tangent to convert the angle to actual distances
- tan(FOV/2) = how far sideways you can see, if looking straight ahead at distance 1

#### Step 2: Camera Coordinate System - Building Your Own 3D Compass

**The fundamental problem:** 
Your camera might be looking in any direction—not just straight ahead. Maybe it's tilted, rotated, or pointing diagonally. How do we define "left," "right," and "up" for a camera that could be oriented anywhere?

**Real-world analogy:**
Imagine you're a photographer. When you hold your camera:
- You know which way you're pointing (that's **Forward**)
- You need to know which way is "left" and "right" from your perspective (that's **Right**)
- You need to know which way is "up" from your camera's viewpoint (that's **Up**)

**The mathematical solution - step by step:**

**Step 1: Start with what we know**
```
Forward = normalize(camera.orientation)  // Where the camera is looking
World_Up = (0, 1, 0)                    // "Up" in the world (always points to sky)
```

**Step 2: Find the "Right" direction using cross product**
```
Right = normalize(Forward × World_Up)
```

**What does the cross product do?**
Think of cross product as "give me a direction perpendicular to both inputs":
- Input 1: **Forward** (where camera looks)
- Input 2: **World_Up** (world's up direction)
- Output: A direction perpendicular to both = the camera's **Right** direction

**Visual example:**
```
If Forward = (0, 0, 1) [looking along Z-axis]
And World_Up = (0, 1, 0) [Y-axis points up]
Then Forward × World_Up = (1, 0, 0) [X-axis points right]
```

**Step 3: Find the camera's "Up" direction**
```
Up = Right × Forward
```

**Why do we need another cross product?**
- The world's "up" might not be the camera's "up" (if camera is tilted)
- We need the camera's actual "up" direction
- Right × Forward gives us a vector perpendicular to both Right and Forward
- This is the camera's true "up" direction

**Complete example with a tilted camera:**
```
// Camera looking diagonally up and right
Forward = normalize(0.5, 0.5, 0.707)  // Diagonal direction
World_Up = (0, 1, 0)                  // World up (Y-axis)

// Calculate Right direction
Right = normalize(Forward × World_Up)
Right = normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.707) × (0, 1, 0))
Right = normalize((0.707, 0, -0.5))   // Points to camera's right

// Calculate camera's Up direction  
Up = Right × Forward
Up = (0.707, 0, -0.5) × (0.5, 0.5, 0.707)
Up = (0.354, -0.707, 0.354)          // Camera's actual up direction
```

**Why this coordinate system works:**
1. **Right** is perpendicular to both Forward and World_Up
2. **Up** is perpendicular to both Right and Forward  
3. **Forward**, **Right**, and **Up** form a "orthonormal basis" (all perpendicular, all length 1)
4. This gives us a complete 3D coordinate system for the camera

**Key insight:**
Cross product A×B always gives a vector perpendicular to both A and B. We use this twice to build a complete coordinate system from just one direction (where the camera looks).
- Right×Forward then points to your actual "up" (accounting for camera tilt)

#### Step 3: Pixel to Ray Conversion - The Magic Translation

**The big picture problem:**
You have a 2D screen with pixels, but you need to shoot 3D rays into a 3D world. How do you convert a pixel coordinate like (150, 200) into a 3D direction like (0.3, 0.1, 0.9)?

**The step-by-step process:**

**Formula breakdown:**
```
pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)
u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale
v = (HEIGHT/2 - y) * pixel_scale
ray.direction = normalize(Right×u + Up×v + Forward)
```

**Step 1: Understanding pixel_scale**
```
pixel_scale = tan(FOV/2) / (WIDTH/2)
```

**What does this do?**
- We know `tan(FOV/2)` tells us how far we can see sideways at distance 1
- `WIDTH/2` is how many pixels from center to edge of screen
- So `pixel_scale` converts "one pixel distance" into "3D world distance"

**Example with numbers:**
```
FOV = 90°, so tan(45°) = 1.0
WIDTH = 800 pixels, so WIDTH/2 = 400 pixels
pixel_scale = 1.0 / 400 = 0.0025

This means: moving 1 pixel on screen = moving 0.0025 units in 3D world
```

**Step 2: Center the pixel coordinates**
```
u = (x - WIDTH/2) * pixel_scale
v = (HEIGHT/2 - y) * pixel_scale
```

**Why subtract WIDTH/2 and HEIGHT/2?**
- Pixel (0,0) is usually at top-left corner of screen
- But we want pixel (0,0) to be at the CENTER of our view
- Subtracting WIDTH/2 makes the center pixel have coordinate 0

**Example transformation:**
```
Screen size: 800×600 pixels
Center pixel: (400, 300)

For pixel (500, 200):
u = (500 - 400) * 0.0025 = 100 * 0.0025 = 0.25
v = (300 - 200) * 0.0025 = 100 * 0.0025 = 0.25

This means: pixel (500,200) is 0.25 units right and 0.25 units up from center
```

**Why is v calculated as (HEIGHT/2 - y) instead of (y - HEIGHT/2)?**
- Computer screens have Y=0 at the TOP
- But 3D worlds usually have Y=0 at the BOTTOM  
- We flip it so "up" on screen means "up" in 3D world

**Step 3: Build the 3D ray direction**
```
ray.direction = normalize(Right×u + Up×v + Forward)
```

**What does this vector addition mean?**
Think of it as giving directions:
- Start by going **Forward** (straight ahead)
- Then go **Right** by amount `u` (positive u = more right, negative u = more left)
- Then go **Up** by amount `v` (positive v = more up, negative v = more down)

**Detailed example:**
```
Forward = (0, 0, 1)    // Looking along Z-axis
Right = (1, 0, 0)      // X-axis points right  
Up = (0, 1, 0)         // Y-axis points up
u = 0.25               // Slightly to the right
v = 0.25               // Slightly up

ray.direction = Right×0.25 + Up×0.25 + Forward×1
              = (1,0,0)×0.25 + (0,1,0)×0.25 + (0,0,1)×1
              = (0.25, 0, 0) + (0, 0.25, 0) + (0, 0, 1)
              = (0.25, 0.25, 1)

After normalize: (0.25, 0.25, 1) / length = (0.24, 0.24, 0.97)
```

**Step 4: Why do we normalize?**
- The vector (0.25, 0.25, 1) has length √(0.25² + 0.25² + 1²) ≈ 1.06
- For ray calculations, we need direction vectors with length exactly 1
- normalize() scales the vector so its length becomes 1, but keeps the same direction

**The complete pixel-to-ray example:**
```
Screen: 800×600, FOV = 90°, click pixel (600, 150)

Step 1: Calculate pixel_scale
pixel_scale = tan(45°) / 400 = 1.0 / 400 = 0.0025

Step 2: Convert to centered coordinates  
u = (600 - 400) × 0.0025 = 0.5        // Half-way to right edge
v = (300 - 150) × 0.0025 = 0.375      // 3/8 of the way up

Step 3: Build direction vector
direction = (1,0,0)×0.5 + (0,1,0)×0.375 + (0,0,1)×1
          = (0.5, 0.375, 1)

Step 4: Normalize
length = √(0.5² + 0.375² + 1²) = √1.390625 ≈ 1.179
normalized = (0.5/1.179, 0.375/1.179, 1/1.179) = (0.424, 0.318, 0.848)

Final ray: origin=(camera_pos), direction=(0.424, 0.318, 0.848)
```

**Key insights for beginners:**
1. **pixel_scale** converts screen distances to world distances
2. **Centering** makes calculations simpler and more intuitive
3. **Vector addition** combines "forward + right + up" movements
4. **Normalization** ensures all rays have the same "speed" (length 1)

## 3. Sphere Intersection: The Complete Derivation

### What is a Sphere?
A **sphere** is like a ball: every point on its surface is exactly the same distance from its center. For example, a sphere with center (2, 3, 4) and radius 5 means every point on the sphere is 5 units away from (2, 3, 4).

### Sphere Equation Derivation
**Distance formula** between two points P and C:
```
distance = √[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²]
```

For a sphere, this distance equals the radius:
```
√[(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)²] = r
```

**Square both sides** to eliminate the square root:
```
(Px-Cx)² + (Py-Cy)² + (Pz-Cz)² = r²
```

**Vector notation**: If P is position and C is center, then (P-C) is vector from center to point:
```
|P - C|² = r²
```

### Ray-Sphere Intersection Derivation
**The question:** Where does ray R(t) = O + t×D hit the sphere?

**Step 1:** Substitute the ray equation into sphere equation
```
|R(t) - C|² = r²
|(O + t×D) - C|² = r²
|(O - C) + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 2:** Let oc = O - C (vector from sphere center to ray origin)
```
|oc + t×D|² = r²
```

**Step 3:** Expand the squared magnitude
The magnitude squared |A|² means A·A (dot product with itself):
```
(oc + t×D)·(oc + t×D) = r²
```

**Step 4:** Expand the dot product using distributive property
```
oc·oc + oc·(t×D) + (t×D)·oc + (t×D)·(t×D) = r²
```

**Step 5:** Simplify using dot product properties
- Dot product is commutative: oc·(t×D) = (t×D)·oc
- Scalar can move outside: (t×D)·(t×D) = t²×(D·D)
```
oc·oc + 2t×(oc·D) + t²×(D·D) = r²
```

**Step 6:** Rearrange into standard quadratic form At² + Bt + C = 0
```
(D·D)t² + 2(oc·D)t + (oc·oc - r²) = 0
```

**The coefficients are:**
- **a = D·D** (usually = 1 since D is normalized)
- **b = 2(oc·D)** 
- **c = oc·oc - r²**

### Solving the Quadratic Equation
**Standard formula:** For At² + Bt + C = 0, solutions are:
```
t = (-B ± √(B² - 4AC)) / 2A
```

**The discriminant Δ = B² - 4AC tells us:**
- **Δ < 0**: No real solutions (ray misses sphere)
- **Δ = 0**: One solution (ray touches sphere at one point)
- **Δ > 0**: Two solutions (ray enters and exits sphere)

**Optimization insight:** We can check if B² < 4AC before doing expensive √ calculation!

### Computing the Surface Normal
**At intersection point P, the normal is:**
```
N = normalize(P - C)
```

**Why?** The normal is the direction pointing "outward" from the sphere surface. Since every point on a sphere is the same distance from center, the outward direction is simply (point - center).

**Direction check:** Make sure normal points away from the ray:
```
if N·D > 0:  // dot product positive means same direction
    N = -N   // flip it
```

## 4. Plane Intersection: Simple Linear Mathematics

### What is a Plane?
A **plane** is a flat surface extending infinitely in all directions. Think of:
- A tabletop extended forever
- A wall that goes on infinitely
- The floor of a room, but infinite

### Plane Equation Derivation
**Method 1 - Point and Normal:**
If you know:
- One point P₀ on the plane
- The normal vector N (perpendicular to the plane)

Then any point P is on the plane if:
```
(P - P₀)·N = 0
```

**Why?** (P - P₀) is a vector from the known point to any point on the plane. If this vector is perpendicular to the normal (dot product = 0), then P is on the plane.

### Ray-Plane Intersection Derivation
**Substitute ray equation R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
((O + t×D) - P₀)·N = 0
(O - P₀ + t×D)·N = 0
```

**Solve for t:**
```
t = (P₀ - O)·N / (D·N)
```

**Special cases:**
- **If D·N ≈ 0:** Ray is parallel to plane (no intersection or infinite intersections)
- **If t < 0:** Intersection is behind the ray origin (not visible)
- **If t ≥ 0:** Valid intersection at distance t

## 5. Cylinder Intersection: Projections and Quadratics

### Understanding Cylinders
A **cylinder** is like a circle "stretched" along an axis:
- **Infinite cylinder:** Like a pipe extending forever in both directions
- **Finite cylinder:** Like a actual pipe with top and bottom caps

### The Mathematical Challenge
**Problem:** A cylinder isn't centered at origin and isn't aligned with coordinate axes.

**Solution:** Use vector projections to work in "cylinder coordinates."

### Cylinder Equation Derivation
**For infinite cylinder:**
- **Axis:** Line through point C in direction V (normalized)
- **Radius:** r

**Key insight:** Distance from any point P to the axis line must equal r.

**Step 1:** Find vector from axis point C to our point P:
```
CP = P - C
```

**Step 2:** Project this vector onto the axis to find the "axis component":
```
axis_component = (CP·V) × V
```
This is how much of CP goes along the axis direction.

**Step 3:** The remaining part is perpendicular to axis:
```
perpendicular_component = CP - axis_component
                       = (P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V
```

**Step 4:** For a point to be on cylinder, perpendicular distance = radius:
```
|perpendicular_component|² = r²
|(P - C) - ((P - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

### Ray-Cylinder Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D:**
```
|(O + t×D - C) - ((O + t×D - C)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Let X = O - C:**
```
|(X + t×D) - ((X + t×D)·V) × V|² = r²
```

**Expand the dot product:**
```
(X + t×D)·V = X·V + t×(D·V)
```

**Substitute back:**
```
|(X + t×D) - (X·V + t×(D·V)) × V|² = r²
|X + t×D - (X·V)×V - t×(D·V)×V|² = r²
|X - (X·V)×V + t×(D - (D·V)×V)|² = r²
```

**Define simplified vectors:**
```
a = D - (D·V)×V    // direction component perpendicular to axis
b = X - (X·V)×V    // origin offset perpendicular to axis
```

**The equation becomes:**
```
|b + t×a|² = r²
(b + t×a)·(b + t×a) = r²
b·b + 2t×(a·b) + t²×(a·a) = r²
```

**Rearrange to quadratic form:**
```
(a·a)t² + 2(a·b)t + (b·b - r²) = 0
```

#### Finite Cylinder: Height Constraints
**After finding intersection point P, check:**
```
height_along_axis = (P - C)·V
if 0 ≤ height_along_axis ≤ cylinder_height:
    valid intersection
```

## 6. Cone Intersection: The Most Complex Case

### Understanding Cones
A **cone** is like a circle that gets smaller as you move along an axis:
- **Apex:** The pointy tip
- **Axis:** The direction the cone points
- **Angle:** How "wide" the cone opens (half-angle from axis to surface)

### Cone Equation Derivation
**Key insight:** At any point P on the cone, the angle between (P - Apex) and Axis equals the cone's half-angle.

**Using dot product to measure angles:**
```
cos(angle) = (A·B) / (|A| × |B|)
```

**For cone with apex A, axis V, and half-angle θ:**
```
cos(θ) = ((P - A)·V) / |P - A|
```

**Rearrange:**
```
((P - A)·V) = |P - A| × cos(θ)
```

**Square both sides:**
```
((P - A)·V)² = |P - A|² × cos²(θ)
```

### Ray-Cone Intersection Derivation
**Substitute R(t) = O + t×D, let X = O - A, m = cos(θ):**
```
((X + t×D)·V)² = |X + t×D|² × m²
```

**Expand left side:**
```
(X·V + t×(D·V))² = (X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)²
```

**Expand right side:**
```
|X + t×D|² × m² = (X·X + 2t×(D·X) + t²×(D·D)) × m²
                 = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Set equal and rearrange:**
```
(X·V)² + 2t×(X·V)×(D·V) + t²×(D·V)² = m²×(X·X) + 2t×m²×(D·X) + t²×m²×(D·D)
```

**Collect terms by powers of t:**
```
[(D·V)² - m²×(D·D)]t² + 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]t + [(X·V)² - m²×(X·X)] = 0
```

**Final quadratic coefficients:**
- **a = (D·V)² - m²×(D·D)**
- **b = 2[(X·V)×(D·V) - m²×(D·X)]**  
- **c = (X·V)² - m²×(X·X)**

### Optimization: Precomputed Constants
**Instead of recalculating trigonometric functions:**
```c
typedef struct {
    double cos_angle = cos(θ/2);      // Calculate once
    double sin_angle = sin(θ/2);      // Calculate once  
    double cos_angle_sq = cos²(θ/2);  // Calculate once
    double tan_half_angle = tan(θ/2); // Calculate once
} cone_constants;
```

**Performance gain:** ~25-30% faster because trigonometric functions are expensive!

# Lighting & Shadows (Simple Explanations)

Now that we know how to create rays, find intersections, and calculate lighting, let's talk about how to make our raytracer look realistic with lighting and shadows. We'll break down each idea step by step, using simple analogies and examples.

## 1. The Phong Lighting Model

### What is the Phong Lighting Model?
The Phong lighting model is a way to make 3D objects look realistic by simulating how light behaves. It combines three types of light:

- **Ambient Light**: Like the general light in a room. Even in shadow, objects aren't completely black because light bounces off walls, ceiling, etc.
- **Diffuse Light**: Like sunlight hitting your face. The more directly the light hits the surface, the brighter it is.
- **Specular Light**: Like a shiny highlight on a polished surface. (We won't cover this in our basic version.)

## 2. Ambient Lighting

### What is Ambient Light?
Ambient light is the general light that fills a room. It doesn't come from any one place—it's like the light that bounces around everywhere.

### How Do We Calculate Ambient Light?
We use a simple formula:
```
I_ambient = ambient_ratio × ambient_color × object_color
```

**Example:**
- If ambient light is 20% white (ambient_ratio = 0.2) and the object is red (object_color = (1, 0, 0)), then:
  ```
  I_ambient = 0.2 × (1, 1, 1) × (1, 0, 0) = (0.2, 0, 0)  // dark red
  ```

## 3. Diffuse Lighting (Lambertian Reflection)

### What is Diffuse Light?
Diffuse light is the light that hits a surface directly. The brightness depends on the angle between the surface normal and the light direction.

### The Physics
- If light hits the surface head-on (perpendicular), it's brightest.
- If light hits at a shallow angle, it's dimmer.

### Lambert's Law
We use the dot product to find the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the light direction:
```
brightness ∝ cos(angle_between_normal_and_light)
```

### Complete Diffuse Formula
```
I_diffuse = light_intensity × light_color × object_color × max(0, N·L) × attenuation
```

**Why max(0, N·L)?** If the dot product is negative, the light is hitting the back side of the surface (should be dark).

## 4. Distance Attenuation

### What is Attenuation?
Attenuation is how light gets dimmer as it travels farther. Think of a flashlight: the farther you are, the dimmer the light.

### Mathematical Model
We use this formula:
```
attenuation = 1 / (1 + kl×d + kq×d²)
```

Where:
- **d** = distance to light
- **kl** = linear attenuation coefficient (e.g., 0.01)
- **kq** = quadratic attenuation coefficient (e.g., 0.001)

**Why this formula?**
- Close to the light (d ≈ 0): attenuation ≈ 1 (full brightness)
- Far from the light (large d): attenuation ≈ 0 (very dim)
- The linear + quadratic terms give a realistic falloff.

## 5. Shadows

### What is a Shadow?
A shadow is a dark area where light is blocked by an object. In raytracing, we check if there's anything between the surface point and the light source.

### How Do We Check for Shadows?
1. Cast a "shadow ray" from the surface point toward the light.
2. If the shadow ray hits any object before reaching the light, the surface is in shadow.

### Shadow Ray Setup
```
shadow_origin = hit_point + ε × light_direction
shadow_direction = light_direction
```

**Why add ε (epsilon)?** Without it, the shadow ray might immediately hit the same surface it started from due to floating-point precision errors (called "shadow acne").

### Shadow Test Algorithm
```
if shadow_ray_hits_any_object AND distance_to_hit < distance_to_light:
    point is in shadow (no direct light)
else:
    point is illuminated (add diffuse lighting)
```

## 6. Putting It All Together

### Final Lighting Formula
```
final_color = I_ambient + I_diffuse
```

**Example:**
- If ambient light is (0.2, 0, 0) and diffuse light is (0.5, 0, 0), then:
  ```
  final_color = (0.2, 0, 0) + (0.5, 0, 0) = (0.7, 0, 0)  // bright red
  ```

# Performance Optimization (Beginner-Friendly)

Now that we know how to create rays, find intersections, and calculate lighting, let's talk about how to make our raytracer faster. We'll break down each optimization step by step, using simple analogies and examples.

## 1. Early Ray Termination

### What is Early Ray Termination?
Early ray termination means stopping the search for intersections as soon as we find a very close hit. It's like finding the closest person in a crowd—once you find someone right in front of you, you don't need to look further.

### How Does It Work?
- If we find an intersection at a very small distance (e.g., less than 0.002 units), we can stop searching.
- This saves time because we don't need to check objects that are farther away.

### Example:
```
if hit_found AND closest_distance < EARLY_TERMINATION_DISTANCE:
    break  // Stop searching
```

## 2. Sphere Discriminant Optimization

### What is the Discriminant?
The discriminant is part of the quadratic formula used to find where a ray hits a sphere. It tells us if the ray hits the sphere at all.

### How Do We Optimize It?
- Calculating the square root (√) is expensive.
- We can check if the discriminant is negative before doing the expensive calculation.
- If the discriminant is negative, the ray misses the sphere.

### Example:
```
if b² < 4ac:
    return no_intersection  // Skip expensive sqrt calculation
```

## 3. Cone Constant Precomputation

### What is Precomputation?
Precomputation means calculating values once and reusing them, instead of calculating them every time.

### How Do We Precompute Cone Constants?
- For a cone, we need values like cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2), and tan(θ/2).
- Instead of calculating these every time a ray hits the cone, we calculate them once when the cone is created.

### Example:
```c
typedef struct {
    double cos_angle = cos(θ/2);      // Calculate once
    double sin_angle = sin(θ/2);      // Calculate once  
    double cos_angle_sq = cos²(θ/2);  // Calculate once
    double tan_half_angle = tan(θ/2); // Calculate once
} cone_constants;
```

**Performance gain:** ~25-30% faster because trigonometric functions are expensive!

# Numerical Considerations (Floating-Point for Beginners)

Now that we've covered the main parts of raytracing, let's talk about a tricky topic: floating-point numbers. Don't worry—we'll break it down into simple ideas!

## Why Floating-Point is Tricky

### What are Floating-Point Numbers?
Floating-point numbers are how computers store decimal numbers (like 3.14 or 0.001). But they aren't perfect—they can't represent some numbers exactly.

### Examples of Floating-Point Quirks
- **0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004** (not exactly 0.3!)
- Very small numbers can become zero.
- Very large numbers can lose precision.

**Analogy:** Think of floating-point numbers like a ruler with tiny marks. You can measure 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, but not exactly 1.15—it might be 1.149999 or 1.150001.

## Epsilon Values and Their Purposes

### What is Epsilon?
Epsilon is a tiny number we use to say "close enough" when comparing floating-point numbers. It helps us avoid errors caused by tiny rounding differences.

### Common Epsilon Values
```
EPSILON = 1e-4        // General "close enough" comparisons
MIN_T = 1e-3          // Minimum ray distance (avoid hitting starting surface)
SHADOW_EPSILON = 1e-6 // Shadow ray offset (smaller for more precision)
```

### Choosing Epsilon Values
- **Too small:** Precision errors cause problems (like "shadow acne").
- **Too large:** Miss valid intersections or create gaps.

**Analogy:** Epsilon is like a small margin of error. If two numbers are within this margin, we consider them equal.

## Safe Floating-Point Comparisons

### Wrong Way
```
if (a == b)  // Almost never true for floating-point!
```

### Right Way
```
if (fabs(a - b) < EPSILON)  // Close enough to be considered equal
```

**Example:**
- If a = 0.1 + 0.2 (≈ 0.30000000000000004) and b = 0.3, then:
  ```
  fabs(a - b) = fabs(0.30000000000000004 - 0.3) = 0.00000000000000004
  ```
  Since 0.00000000000000004 < EPSILON, we consider a and b equal.

# Advanced Topics

In this section, we'll explore some advanced topics in raytracing that build upon the foundational concepts we've covered so far. These topics include ray-object intersection, shading models, and optimization techniques.

## Ray-Object Intersection

**Goal:** Understand how to determine if a ray intersects with an object in 3D space.

**Problem:** Given a ray with origin O and direction D, and a sphere with center C and radius R, determine if the ray intersects the sphere.

**Theory:**
The ray-sphere intersection can be determined by solving the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 \cdot (D \cdot D) + 2t \cdot (D \cdot (O - C)) + (O - C) \cdot (O - C) - R^2 = 0
\]
where \( t \) is the parameter along the ray.

**Solution:**
1. Calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   \Delta = (2 \cdot (D \cdot (O - C)))^2 - 4 \cdot (D \cdot D) \cdot ((O - C) \cdot (O - C) - R^2)
   \]
2. If \(\Delta < 0\), the ray does not intersect the sphere.
3. If \(\Delta = 0\), the ray is tangent to the sphere.
4. If \(\Delta > 0\), the ray intersects the sphere at two points.

**Practical Implementation:**
```c
bool ray_sphere_intersection(t_point3 O, t_vector3 D, t_point3 C, double R, double *t) {
    t_vector3 OC = vector3_subtract(O, C);
    double a = vector3_dot(D, D);
    double b = 2.0 * vector3_dot(D, OC);
    double c = vector3_dot(OC, OC) - R * R;
    double discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c;

    if (discriminant < 0) {
        return false; // No intersection
    }

    double t1 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2.0 * a);
    double t2 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2.0 * a);

    if (t1 > 0) {
        *t = t1;
        return true;
    } else if (t2 > 0) {
        *t = t2;
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

## Shading Models

### Flat Shading
Flat shading means using a single normal per face/primitive. The color is calculated once per face, giving a faceted look.

**Implementation:**
```c
t_color3 flat_shading(t_hit *hit, t_light *light) {
    t_color3 color = {0, 0, 0};
    t_vector3 light_dir = normalize(light->position - hit->point);
    double diff = fmax(dot(hit->normal, light_dir), 0.0);
    color += diff * light->intensity * light->color;
    return color;
}
```

### Gouraud Shading
Gouraud shading means calculating colors at the vertices of a polygon and interpolating them across the surface. This gives a smoother look than flat shading.

**Implementation:**
```c
t_color3 gouraud_shading(t_hit *hit, t_light *light) {
    t_color3 color = {0, 0, 0};
    for (int i = 0; i < hit->num_vertices; i++) {
        t_vector3 light_dir = normalize(light->position - hit->vertices[i]);
        double diff = fmax(dot(hit->normals[i], light_dir), 0.0);
        color += diff * light->intensity * light->color;
    }
    return color / hit->num_vertices; // Average color
}
```

### Phong Shading
Phong shading means calculating the color at each pixel based on the normal at that pixel. This gives the smoothest and most realistic results, especially for shiny surfaces.

**Implementation:**
```c
t_color3 phong_shading(t_hit *hit, t_light *light, t_vector3 view_dir) {
    t_color3 ambient = {0.1, 0.1, 0.1};
    t_color3 diffuse = {0, 0, 0};
    t_color3 specular = {0, 0, 0};

    t_vector3 light_dir = normalize(light->position - hit->point);
    double diff = fmax(dot(hit->normal, light_dir), 0.0);
    diffuse = diff * light->intensity * light->color;

    t_vector3 reflect_dir = reflect(-light_dir, hit->normal);
    double spec = pow(fmax(dot(view_dir, reflect_dir), 0.0), 32);
    specular = spec * light->intensity * light->color;

    return ambient + diffuse + specular;
}
```

## Acceleration Structures

### Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)
BVH is a tree structure where each node represents a bounding volume that encloses a part of the scene. It speeds up ray-object intersection tests by allowing the raytracer to quickly eliminate objects that are not in the ray's path.

**Construction:**
1. Start with all objects in a single bounding volume (the root).
2. Split the volume into two child volumes, each enclosing part of the objects.
3. Repeat recursively for each child until a leaf node contains a small number of objects.

**Traversal:**
1. For each ray, traverse the BVH from the root.
2. For each node, test if the ray intersects the bounding volume.
3. If it does, check the child nodes. If not, skip that branch.

**Performance Gain:** BVH can provide 5-50x speedup for complex scenes.

### KD-Tree
KD-Tree is a binary tree where each node represents an axis-aligned bounding box. It's similar to BVH but uses a different splitting strategy.

**Construction:**
1. Choose a splitting axis (usually X, Y, or Z) and a median point.
2. Create a node with the median point, splitting the objects into two groups: left and right.
3. Recursively build the left and right subtrees.

**Traversal:**
1. For each ray, traverse the KD-Tree from the root.
2. For each node, test if the ray intersects the bounding box.
3. If it does, check the left and right children. If not, skip that branch.

**Performance Gain:** KD-Tree is optimal for specific scene types and can provide significant speedup.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Implement Acceleration Structures**: Add BVH or KD-Tree support for faster rendering.
2. **Add Texture Mapping**: Apply 2D images to 3D surfaces for realism.
3. **Implement Reflection and Refraction**: Simulate shiny and transparent surfaces.
4. **Add Support for Triangle Meshes**: Allow complex models made of triangles.
5. **Implement Advanced Shading Models**: Such as Cook-Torrance or Lambertian reflectance.
6. **Add Environment Mapping**: For simulating reflective surfaces like water or glass.
7. **Implement Global Illumination**: Simulate indirect lighting for more realism.
8. **Add Motion Blur**: For simulating the blur of fast-moving objects.
9. **Implement Depth of Field**: For simulating camera focus effects.
10. **Add Support for Animated Scenes**: Allow moving objects and changing lights.
